# CLChess
This is just a small command line version of chess for me to get back into Python programming.
My goal is to make it as complete as possible in terms of both functionality and looks.

# TODO
- Asking for move (notation will be: Ne3 f5 - 2 separate inputs)
- Figuring out all possibles moves at any point
- Highlightning selected piece and possible moves
